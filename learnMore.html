            <h6>Understanding Homelessness</h6>
            <pre>Homelessness is an enduring issue affecting millions worldwide, often reflecting broader systemic
problems such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate support systems. One
significant factor contributing to the rise in homelessness is the increase in rent prices.
According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a $100 increase in median rents is
associated with a nine percent rise in homelessness rates. From 2001 to 2022, median rents
increased by 19 percent after adjusting for inflation, further exacerbating the crisis.

Homelessness has been on a continuous rise across the United States since 2016, with the
situation reaching its peak in 2023, marking the highest levels seen in the last decade.
This issue does not affect everyone equally, as different demographic groups and  states
experience varying degrees of impact. The disparities in how homelessness affects these
populations highlight the complexity and uneven distribution of this growing crisis.

In this graph, the intensity of the blue shading indicates the level of homelessness in
each state; darker shades represent higher levels of homelessness. It is evident that the
states on the coasts are more susceptible to homelessness. Beyond having larger populations,
these coastal states, including New York, Washington D.C., California, and Oregon, face high
living costs, which significantly contribute to the scarcity of affordable housing. The
combination of dense populations and elevated living expenses makes it particularly challenging
for individuals in these regions to secure affordable housing, exacerbating the homelessness
crisis. This pattern underscores how economic factors, such as the cost of living, play a
crucial role in the distribution of homelessness across different states.

This graph, which depicts the number of people experiencing homelessness per 10,000 individuals,
reveals that certain racial groups are more vulnerable to homelessness than others. Native
Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, in particular, are significantly affected, highlighting the fact
that minority groups experience homelessness at much higher rates compared to whites. Addressing
homelessness is crucial to ensuring that everyone can enjoy a decent standard of living without
facing unequal living conditions based on their racial or ethnic background. It is essential to 
tackle this issue to promote better and equal living situations for all.
