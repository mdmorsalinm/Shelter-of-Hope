            <pre>
At Shelter of Hope, our mission is to provide support, resources, and shelter to individuals experiencing
homelessness. We strive to create a safe environment where everyone has the opportunity to rebuild their
lives.

            <pre>
Shelter of Hope was founded by two passionate software engineering majors from Brooklyn Tech, Jason and
Morsalin. Driven by our desire to make a tangible difference in our community, we combined our technical
skills and compassionate hearts to establish Shelter of Hope. We believe that everyone deserves a place
to call home, and we are dedicated to making that a reality.
